                    <p>SentinelPay exists to revolutionize financial security by providing an AI-driven fraud detection system that proactively identifies 
                        fraudulent activities in real-time. The financial sector faces growing threats from increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, while 
                        traditional rule-based detection systems struggle with adaptability, leading to high false positives and missed anomalies. SentinelPay 
                        addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning to enhance fraud detection accuracy, safeguard customer transactions, and provide 
                        actionable insights without compromising speed. By empowering financial institutions with advanced, scalable, and cost-efficient fraud prevention 
                        tools, SentinelPay strengthens trust, reduces financial losses, and ensures long-term adaptability.</p>

                    <p>SentinelPay is an AI-powered fraud detection system designed to analyze financial transactions in real-time. By leveraging machine learning anomaly detection techniques, SentinelPay classifies transactions into two categories: fraudulent or not fraudulent. The system integrates seamlessly with banking systems via a REST API and deploys efficiently using Docker to ensure scalability. A lightweight web interface is included to allow users to visualize flagged transactions and system performance metrics.

                    The objective of our project is to develop a highly accurate machine learning model for fraud detection, integrating SentinelPay with a simulated banking system via a REST API. We will ensure scalability using Docker to handle high transaction volumes, build a web interface for visualizing flagged transactions and performance metrics, and conduct rigorous testing to validate model reliability and effectiveness.
